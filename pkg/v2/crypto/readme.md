TODO:

-- base58 checkEncode and checkDecode Methods are failing. 


- Wif decode -- This needs B58CheckDecode, which is failing tests
- Merkle Tree implementation

Note: The WIF file was trimmed down quite a bit, in that we only have the WIFEncode and WIFDecode methods for a privateKey left; no file for it, not sure if you needed it as a struct.
