# Package - Wire


The neo wire package will implement the network protocol displayed here: http://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/network-protocol.html

This package will act as a standalone package.


Alternative implementation of the wire from V1


-- binary decodings are the same, so we took them from original package
One advantage of seperating the package like this is easier testability.
